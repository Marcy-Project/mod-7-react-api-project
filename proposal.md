# Pokemon Zhu 2.0

Created by Linqing Zhu, and Mei Zhu.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Pokemon Zhu 2.0 is for Pokemon enthusiasts. Users will be able to search for pokemons and add their favorite pokemon into a collection. 

## API & React Router

This application will use the Pokemon API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemonName}
  - This endpoint provided us with an object. 
  - We used the `id`, `sprites.front_default`, and `name` from each object. 

- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemonId}
  - This will fetch a pokemon data by id
  - I will use the `id`, `name`, `stats`, and `sprites.front_default`

- http://localhost:4000/likeCollection
  - This will fetch a list of pokemon that user added to favorite
  - For each like collection, I will use the `id`, `name`, `stats`, and `sprites.front_default`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/pokemon` page, users can search a for a pokemon or randomly generate pokemon.
* On the `/{pokemonName}` page, users can see the details of each pokemon and click "add to favorite" that will add the pokemon to "favorites" collection.
* On the `/favorite` page, users can see all the pokemons from the "favorites" collection.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Users will be able to ... sort pokemon by type. 
* Users will be able to ... see the shiny versions of the pokemon in the pop up page.
